    "* Gain hands-on experience on network addressing.\n",
    "* Practical experience with IPv4 and MAC addresses, prefixes, and [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) using python.\n",

    "> Gain hands-on experience and learn by doing! Understand how theoretical knowledge discussed in lectures relates to practice. Develop motivation for gaining further theoretical and practical knowledge beyond the subject material.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview:\n",
    "In this workshop, you will gain practical experience on networking basics we have covered in the classroom focusing on network addressing. Firstly, you will learn how to represent and manipulate network addresses using the *netaddr* python library.  Specifically, you will experiment with IPv4 and MAC addresses, subnets, masks, prefixes, and CIDR.  "

Just like in the lectures, the topics we cover in the workshops are quite deep and we can only do so much in two hours. There is much more to learn and coming prepared to the workshop is one of the best ways to gain more knowledge! For example, there are a few questions in each workshop which you can answer beforehand.\n",

    "> __Self-learning__ is one of the most important skills that you should acquire as a student. Today, self-learning is much easier than it used to be thanks to a plethora of online resources.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Workshop Preparation Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Common step for all workshops: read the Workshop Manual.    \n",
    "2. Review relevant lecture slides on addressing, graph theory, and routing.\n",
    "3. Read [netaddr](https://netaddr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/index.html) documentation.\n",
    "4. Practice your Python skills.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Tasks and Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the procedures described below, perform the given tasks and answer the workshop questions __preferably__ on the Python notebook itself! If you prefer, however, you can still provide answers as separate scripts and submit as a pdf file in addition to the Python notebook (code can be zipped). Ensure that your code is clean and appropriately commented. \n",
    "\n",
    "__The resulting notebook will be (part of) your Workshop Report!__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __The goal is to learn__, NOT blindly follow the procedures in the fastest possible way! __Do not simply copy-paste answers (from Internet, friends, etc.). You can and should use all available resources but only to develop your own understanding. If you copy-paste, you will pay the price in the final exam!__"
